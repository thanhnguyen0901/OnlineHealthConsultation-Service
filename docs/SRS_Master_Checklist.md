## 7. Progress Log

- 2026-04-18:
  - Re-ran analysis after prisma reset.
  - Renamed architecture doc to correct filename.
  - Expanded baseline/review/plan/database docs with traceability, acceptance criteria, and mapping details.
  - Refreshed master checklist to reflect latest codebase and required next work.
  - Created missing docs: API contract, auth matrix, test strategy, deployment guide, and 4 ADRs.
  - Recreated `prisma/` baseline files (`schema.prisma`, `seed.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, migrations README) for PostgreSQL-first architecture.
  - Updated `package.json` scripts to remove broken references and align with current phase-0 setup.
  - Added env validation, global HTTP exception filter, and request-id logging baseline in `src/main.ts`.
  - Fixed Identity registration logic to match new doctor-specialty relationship model.
  - Verified `prisma generate`, `npm run type-check`, and `npm run build` successfully.
  - Created and applied initial Prisma migration (`20260418065106_init_postgres`) and ran seed successfully.
  - Verified `npm run test` (no tests yet) to close phase-0 baseline verification.
  - Implemented phase-1 identity hardening: refresh/logout/forgot/reset password flows with session rotation and revoke logic.
  - Applied role/ownership policy enforcement with `RolesGuard` and `OwnershipGuard` on user-scoped/admin endpoints.
  - Added auth-related audit logging and admin user deactivation endpoint under role policy.
  - Re-verified `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test` after phase-1 changes.
  - Started Phase 2 implementation: added patient profile APIs, doctor profile/schedule/specialty APIs, admin doctor approval update, admin specialty CRUD, and public discovery APIs.
  - Added new modules `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Specialty`, and `Discovery` with role-based guards applied.
  - Verified `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test` after Phase 2 code integration.
  - Phase 2 marked complete; detailed access-control testing evidence was skipped based on user request.
  - Implemented Phase 3 core APIs: Question lifecycle (create/list/answer/moderate) and Appointment lifecycle (book/list/cancel/confirm/complete/admin list).
  - Added booking conflict prevention for both doctor and patient with serializable transaction flow.
  - Added outbox event writes for question answered and appointment created flows.
  - Verified `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test` after Phase 3 integration.
  - Started Phase 1 identity hardening: added auth endpoints for refresh/logout/forgot-password/reset-password and implemented session/token rotation flow.
  - Added role decorator/guard scaffolding and re-verified `type-check`, `build`, and `test`.
  - Started Phase 4 implementation: added consultation/rating services and new DTOs for session lifecycle, summary, prescription, and moderation.
  - Added phase-4 controllers/routes: consultation start/join/end/summary/prescription, patient rating create/list, and admin rating moderation.
  - Extended phase-4 scope with consultation history APIs (`/consultations/mine`, `/consultations/doctor/me`) for ownership-scoped result access.
  - Added channel selection with VIDEO->CHAT fallback behavior at consultation start when video provider is unavailable.
  - Added duplicate-rating guard (one rating per appointment) and re-verified `npm run type-check` + `npm run build`.
  - Updated FR/Phase statuses for consultation, prescription, and rating to `IN_PROGRESS` while verification and closure evidence are being completed.
